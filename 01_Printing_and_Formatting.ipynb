    "# Python Print Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function is used to display output on the console. It takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console separated by spaces by default. In this chapter, we will discuss the various features of the `print()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of using the `print()` function to display a simple string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass multiple arguments to the `print()` function, which will be printed separated by a space by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"The answer is\", 42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The answer is 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the `end` Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `print()` function adds a newline character at the end of the output. You can change this behavior using the `end` parameter. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello\", end=\"\")\n",
    "print(\"world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Helloworld\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any string as the `end` parameter, not just an empty string. Here is an example of using a space character as the `end` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"The answer is\", end=\" \")\n",
    "print(42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The answer is 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formatting Output\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use formatted strings to format the output of the `print()` function. Formatted strings start with an `f` character before the opening quote and can contain expressions inside curly braces. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use formatted strings to pad and justify output. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "print(f\"The answer is {x:5}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The answer is    42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used the `:5` specifier to pad the output with spaces up to a width of 5 characters. We can also use `0` to pad with zeroes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "print(f\"The answer is {x:05}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The answer is 00042\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the `<`, `>`, and `^` characters to left-justify, right-justify, and center the output, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "print(f\"The answer is {x:<5}\")\n",
    "print(f\"The answer is {x:>5}\")\n",
    "print(f\"The answer is {x:^5}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The answer is 42   \n",
    "The answer is    42\n",
    "The answer is  42  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rounding Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use formatted strings to round numerical values to a certain number of decimal places. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pi = 3.14159265359\n",
    "print(f\"The value of pi is approximately {pi:.2f}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The value of pi is approximately 3.14.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used the `.2f` specifier to round the value of `pi` to 2 decimal places. You can change the number of decimal places by changing the number after the `.`."
