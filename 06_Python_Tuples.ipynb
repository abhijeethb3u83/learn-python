    "## Creating Tuples\n",
    "Tuples can be created by enclosing items within parentheses `()` or using the `tuple()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating tuples\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "another_tuple = tuple(['a', 'b', 'c'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may want to create a tuple with a single element. In such cases, it is important to include a trailing comma `,` after the element, otherwise, it will be interpreted as a regular value, not a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a single element tuple\n",
    "single_tuple = (42,)  # Note the trailing comma\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The trailing comma distinguishes the tuple from a regular value or variable enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Not a tuple\n",
    "not_a_tuple = (42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Including the trailing comma ensures consistent tuple behavior, even when there is only a single element.\n",

    "Tuples can contain elements of different types, including other tuples, lists, or objects. They are versatile data structures for various programming needs.\n",

    "## Tuple Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples in Python come with several built-in methods that provide useful functionality. Let's explore some of these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `count()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)\n",
    "count = my_tuple.count(2)\n",
    "print(count)  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `index()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)\n",
    "index = my_tuple.index(3)\n",
    "print(index)  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `len()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a tuple.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "length = len(my_tuple)\n",
    "print(length)  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that tuples are immutable, so methods that modify the tuple, such as `append()` or `remove()`, are not available. However, you can perform operations like slicing, concatenation, and unpacking on tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "sliced_tuple = my_tuple[1:]  # Output: (2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple1 = (1, 2)\n",
    "tuple2 = (3, 4)\n",
    "concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b, c = my_tuple  # Tuple unpacking\n",
    "print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Tuple Packing and Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple packing and unpacking are powerful features of tuples in Python. Let's explore some practical applications of these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Packing\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple packing allows us to create a tuple by assigning multiple values to a single variable. We can pack values with or without using parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = \"John\", 25, \"USA\"  # Packing without parentheses\n",
    "print(person)  # Output: (\"John\", 25, \"USA\")\n",
    "\n",
    "person = (\"John\", 25, \"USA\")  # Packing with parentheses\n",
    "print(person)  # Output: (\"John\", 25, \"USA\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples, we're packing the values \"John\", 25, and \"USA\" into the `person` tuple. The resulting tuples are the same, regardless of whether parentheses are used or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking allows us to assign individual elements of a tuple to separate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = (\"John\", 25, \"USA\")\n",
    "name, age, country = person\n",
    "print(name)     # Output: John\n",
    "print(age)      # Output: 25\n",
    "print(country)  # Output: USA\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're unpacking the `person` tuple and assigning its elements to the variables `name`, `age`, and `country`. This makes it easier to access and work with individual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swapping Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking is commonly used for swapping the values of variables without needing a temporary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b = b, a\n",
    "print(a)  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're swapping the values of `a` and `b` using tuple unpacking. This technique can be handy when you need to exchange values between variables efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning Multiple Values from Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can be useful for returning multiple values from a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_info():\n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    age = 25\n",
    "    country = \"USA\"\n",
    "    return name, age, country\n",
    "\n",
    "person = get_info()\n",
    "print(person)  # Output: (\"John\", 25, \"USA\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `get_info()` function returns a tuple containing the person's name, age, and country. By using tuple packing, we can easily return multiple values and assign them to a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These practical applications of tuple packing and unpacking demonstrate the flexibility and usefulness of tuples in various scenarios."

    "## Tuple Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples in Python support comparison operations, which allow us to compare two tuples based on their elements. Let's explore some examples and applications of tuple comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are compared element by element, starting from the first element. If the elements are equal, the comparison continues to the next element. The comparison stops as soon as a difference is found, and the result is determined based on the comparison of that element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "tuple2 = (1, 2, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(tuple1 < tuple2)  # Output: True\n",
    "print(tuple1 > tuple2)  # Output: False\n",
    "print(tuple1 == tuple2) # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we compare `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The comparison is performed element-wise, and the result is based on the first differing element. Since the third element in `tuple1` is less than the corresponding element in `tuple2`, `tuple1` is considered smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple comparison can be beneficial in various situations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sorting Tuples: Tuples can be sorted using the built-in `sorted()` function or by using the `sort()` method of a list of tuples. The comparison operator `<` is used to determine the order of tuples during sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = [(\"John\", 25), (\"Alice\", 20), (\"Bob\", 22)]\n",
    "sorted_students = sorted(students)  # Sort by name (lexicographic order)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sorted_students)\n",
    "# Output: [(\"Alice\", 20), (\"Bob\", 22), (\"John\", 25)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `students` list contains tuples with names and ages. By using the `sorted()` function, we can sort the list based on the names (lexicographic order) using tuple comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Searching and Filtering: Tuple comparison can be useful for searching and filtering tuples based on specific criteria. For example, you can use tuple comparison in list comprehensions or generator expressions to filter tuples that satisfy certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = [(\"John\", 25), (\"Alice\", 20), (\"Bob\", 22)]\n",
    "adult_students = [student for student in students if student[1] >= 18]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(adult_students)\n",
    "# Output: [(\"John\", 25), (\"Bob\", 22)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we filter the `students` list to include only tuples representing adult students (age 18 or above) using tuple comparison with the condition `student[1] >= 18`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple comparison allows for efficient sorting, searching, and filtering of tuples based on their elements. It provides a powerful mechanism to handle and manipulate tuples in various contexts."
