    "# Python Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique elements in Python. They are commonly used for mathematical operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from them.\n",

    "## Creating Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can be created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}  # Using curly braces\n",
    "set2 = set([3, 4, 5])  # Using set() function\n",

    "## Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in Python provide various operations to manipulate and perform calculations on sets. These operations include union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Sets can be operated using both methods and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union\n",
    "\n",
    "The union of two sets contains all the unique elements from both sets. It can be performed using the `union()` method or the `|` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the union() method\n",
    "set3 = set1.union(set2)\n",
    "print(set3)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the | operator\n",
    "set4 = set1 | set2\n",
    "print(set4)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of two sets contains the elements that are common to both sets. It can be performed using the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the intersection() method\n",
    "set3 = set1.intersection(set2)\n",
    "print(set3)  # Output: {3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the & operator\n",
    "set4 = set1 & set2\n",
    "print(set4)  # Output: {3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between two sets contains the elements that are in the first set but not in the second set. It can be performed using the `difference()` method or the `-` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the difference() method\n",
    "set3 = set1.difference(set2)\n",
    "print(set3)  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the - operator\n",
    "set4 = set1 - set2\n",
    "print(set4)  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetric Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric difference of two sets contains the elements that are in either set but not in both. It can be performed using the `symmetric_difference()` method or the `^` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the symmetric_difference() method\n",
    "set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n",
    "print(set3)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the ^ operator\n",
    "set4 = set1 ^ set2\n",
    "print(set4)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of operators (`|`, `&`, `-`, `^`) provides a concise way to perform set operations. However, the methods (`union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`, `symmetric_difference()`) offer more flexibility and can be combined with other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that both methods and operators perform the same operations, and you can choose the one that suits your coding style and preference."

    "## Set Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "Set comprehension in Python provides a concise way to create sets based on an iterable, with an optional condition. It follows a similar syntax to list comprehension but uses curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general syntax of set comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_set = {expression for item in iterable if condition}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples to understand set comprehension better:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Squares of Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squares = {x**2 for x in numbers}\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a set `squares` using set comprehension. It contains the squares of numbers from the `numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Uppercase Characters\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "uppercase_chars = {char for char in string if char.isupper()}\n",
    "print(uppercase_chars)  # Output: {'H', 'W'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use set comprehension to create a set `uppercase_chars` that contains all the uppercase characters from the given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Filter Even Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n",
    "even_numbers = {x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0}\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we filter out the even numbers from the set `numbers` using set comprehension and create a new set `even_numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set comprehension is a powerful feature that allows you to create sets in a concise and efficient way, combining iteration and conditionals. It provides a convenient method to generate sets based on existing iterables or perform data transformations."
