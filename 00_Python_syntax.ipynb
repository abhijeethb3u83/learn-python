    "# Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax refers to the set of rules and principles that define the structure of a Python program. These rules govern how the program is written and how the interpreter interprets the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses whitespace indentation to indicate blocks of code. In other programming languages, curly braces ({}) or keywords such as \"begin\" and \"end\" are used to define blocks of code. In Python, the whitespace at the beginning of a line determines the block of code it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not positive\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are used to explain what the code does or to add notes for other developers who may read the code. In Python, comments begin with a pound (#) symbol and continue to the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This is also a comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store data in a program. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric types (int, float, complex)\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Booleans\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Numeric types\n",
    "x = 5  # integer\n",
    "y = 2.7  # float\n",
    "z = 3 + 4j  # complex\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strings\n",
    "s1 = \"hello\"\n",
    "s2 = 'world'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Booleans\n",
    "a = True\n",
    "b = False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lists\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples\n",
    "tup = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sets\n",
    "st = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionaries\n",
    "dct = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Arithmetic operators\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 3\n",
    "print(x + y)  # 13\n",
    "print(x - y)  # 7\n",
    "print(x * y)  # 30\n",
    "print(x / y)  # 3.3333...\n",
    "print(x % y)  # 1\n",
    "print(x ** y)  # 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparison operators\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "print(a > b)  # True\n",
    "print(a < b)  # False\n",
    "print(a == b)  # False\n",
    "print(a != b)  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical operators\n",
    "p = True\n",
    "q = False\n",
    "print(p and q)  # False\n",
    "print(p or q)  # True\n",
    "print(not p)  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bitwise operators\n",
    "x = 5  # 101\n",
    "y = 3  # 011\n",
    "print(x & y)  # 001 (AND)\n",
    "print(x | y)  # 111 (OR)\n",
    "print(x ^ y)  # 110 (XOR)\n",
    "print(~x)  # -6 (NOT)\n",
    "print(x << 1)  # 010 (left shift)\n",
    "print(x >> 1)  # 010 (right shift)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment operators\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "x += 2  # equivalent to x = x + 2\n",
    "x -= 2  # equivalent to x = x - 2\n",
