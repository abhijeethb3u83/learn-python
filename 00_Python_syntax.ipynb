    "## Indentation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, indentation is a significant aspect of the syntax and structure of the code. It is used to define blocks of code and determine the scope of statements. Here are some important points to note about indentation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indentation is typically done using **four spaces** per level. This is the recommended convention in Python, although some developers may use tabs or a different number of spaces.\n",
    "- Indentation is used to indicate the **beginning and end of blocks** of code, such as loops, conditional statements, and function definitions. All statements within a block must be indented at the same level.\n",
    "- Indentation is **mandatory** in Python. Incorrect indentation can result in syntax errors or logical errors in the code.\n",
    "- Nested blocks of code are indented further to visually represent the hierarchy of the code.\n",
    "- Consistent indentation enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand the structure and flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate indentation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    if len(name) > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "        print(\"Welcome to the program.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, anonymous!\")\n",
    "        print(\"Please enter your name.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Thank you for using the program.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the greet function\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `if` statement and the `else` statement are indented within the `greet` function block. The statements within each block are indented further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to maintain consistent and correct indentation throughout your Python code to ensure proper execution and readability.\n"

    "## Keywords\n",
    "Keywords in Python are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names or function names). These keywords are an integral part of the language and have specific purposes in Python syntax and semantics. Here are some important Python keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `and`, `or`, `not`: Used for logical operations to combine or negate conditions.\n",
    "- `if`, `else`, `elif`: Used for conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- `for`, `while`: Used for creating loops to iterate over sequences or perform repeated actions.\n",
    "- `def`, `return`: Used for defining functions and specifying their return values.\n",
    "- `class`, `self`: Used for creating and working with classes and objects in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "- `import`, `from`, `as`: Used for importing modules and packages into the current program.\n",
    "- `try`, `except`, `finally`: Used for implementing exception handling to catch and handle errors.\n",
    "- `True`, `False`, `None`: Used for representing boolean values and the absence of a value, respectively.\n",
    "- `in`, `is`: Used for testing membership and identity operations, respectively.\n",
    "- `break`, `continue`, `pass`: Used for altering the flow of control in loops or defining empty code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of using these keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Logical operations\n",
    "is_valid = True\n",
    "has_permission = False\n",
    "if is_valid and not has_permission:\n",
    "    print(\"Access denied.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conditional statements\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not yet an adult.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loops\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = multiply(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classes and objects\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "my_circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "print(my_circle.area())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing modules\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception handling\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and utilizing these keywords effectively, you'll be able to write more expressive and powerful Python programs."

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "One common mistake in Python syntax is forgetting to include the colon (`:`) after a statement that requires it, such as an `if` or `for` statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Correct syntax\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Incorrect syntax\n",
    "if x > 5\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")  # Missing colon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common mistake is mixing spaces and tabs for indentation, which can cause indentation errors and make code difficult to read. It is recommended to use spaces for indentation and configure your text editor or IDE to replace tabs with spaces.\n",
