    "# Python Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a reserved memory location used to store values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Naming Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "2. A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assigning Values to Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are assigned with the = operator. The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in a single statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x, y, z = \"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. That means, the data type of a variable is determined at run time, based on the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5      # x is an integer\n",
    "x = \"Hello\" # x is now a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a variable, use the `del` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "del x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempting to use the variable after it has been deleted will raise a `NameError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "# NameError: name 'x' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuple Unpacking and Variable Swapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can assign multiple variables at once using a tuple. This is known as tuple unpacking. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x, y, z = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This assigns the value 1 to `x`, the value 2 to `y`, and the value 3 to `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use tuple unpacking to swap the values of two variables. For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "y = 2\n",
    "x, y = y, x\n",
    "print(x) # Output: 2\n",
    "print(y) # Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we first assign the value 1 to `x` and the value 2 to `y`. We then use tuple unpacking to swap the values of `x` and `y`. The line `x, y = y, x` is equivalent to the following two lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temp = y\n",
    "y = x\n",
    "x = temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using tuple unpacking is a more concise and readable way to swap the values of two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking can also be used to assign values from a tuple to individual variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "a, b, c = t\n",
    "print(a) # Output: 1\n",
    "print(b) # Output: 2\n",
    "print(c) # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we define a tuple `t` with three values. We then use tuple unpacking to assign the values of `t` to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking is a useful feature in Python that can make our code more concise and readable. It is particularly useful when working with functions that return multiple values.\n"

    "# Variable Scope in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable scope refers to the part of a program where a variable is accessible. Python has three levels of variable scope: global, local, and nonlocal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that are defined outside of any function or class have global scope. These variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including within functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_x():\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_x()  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `x` is defined in the global scope and can be accessed from within the `print_x` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that are defined inside a function or class have local scope. These variables can only be accessed from within that function or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_x():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_x()  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `x` is defined within the `print_x` function and can only be accessed from within that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nonlocal Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that are defined in a parent function can be accessed by a nested function using the `nonlocal` keyword. This allows the nested function to modify the variable defined in the parent function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    def inner():\n",
    "        nonlocal x\n",
    "        x = 20\n",
    "    inner()\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "outer()  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `x` is defined in the `outer` function and is modified by the `inner` function using the `nonlocal` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `nonlocal` keyword, Python has several other keywords that are used to define variable scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `global`: Allows a variable to be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "- `local`: Specifies that a variable should have local scope.\n",
    "- `enclosing`: Specifies that a variable should have nonlocal scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_x():\n",
    "    global x\n",
    "    x = 20\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_x()  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(x)   # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `global` keyword is used to modify the global variable `x` from within the `print_x` function."
