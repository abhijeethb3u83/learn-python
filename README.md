# Learn Python

Welcome to the **Learn Python** project! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook files (`ipynb`) that serve as markdown notes for various Python topics. Each topic is listed in the form of `00_Topic.ipynb` to maintain a consistent ordering.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-python.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd learn-python
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. The Jupyter Notebook interface should open in your browser. You can now browse and open the `.ipynb` files to access the Python topic notes.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook files in this project are named using a two-digit prefix followed by an underscore and the topic name. The prefix helps in maintaining a consistent order and is used for sorting the files.

For example, the naming convention `00_Topic.ipynb` means that it is the first topic in the series. As you progress through the topics, the prefix will increment accordingly.
